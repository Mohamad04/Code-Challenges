	When you post a message on Facebook, depending on the number of people who like your post, Facebook displays different information.
If no one likes your post, it doesn’t display anything.
If only one person likes your post, it displays: the user name
If two people like your post, it displays: [Friend 1] and [Friend 2]
If more than two people like your post, it displays: [friend 1], [friend 2], and [number of other people] others like your post.


Write a function that accepts a list of user names. Display a message based on the above pattern.




Input: ['Saleem', 'Osama']


Output: Saleem and Osama


Input: ['Saleem', 'Ameer', 'Khaled', 'Ahmed'] 


Output: Saleem, Ameer, and 2 others like your post

3-   You are part of a store management team. Write a function that accepts an array of arrays. Each array element represents an order from a customer and contains the cost of each purchased item in that order. For example [[1.5, 2, 1.5], [3,4,3]] the first array [1.5, 2, 1.5] contains three items with different pricing in dollars. Print out the index of the highest order value (sum of order items).



Input: [[1,2,3], [2,3,4]]
Output: 1
Input: [[1.5], [2, 3], [10, 1]]
Output: 2

4-	Design a cinema seats booking system. The cinema hall seats are designed to be in a V shape. So the first line has the largest number of seats and the last line of the hall contains the least amount of seats. The booking must be in order from the first line till the end (rule of the cinema). Each line will have fewer seats compared to the front one by 1 seat. So if the first line has 3 seats then the second line contains 2 and the last one contains 1 only.Write a function that takes two arguments: the number of seats available in the first line, the second argument is the number of registered visitors in the hall. Print out the percentage of seats booking from the actual total seat numbers.
Input: 7, 7
Output: 25%
Explanation: The first line in the hall contains 7 seats, which means we have 28 seats in total in that hall. Then the percentage of the booked seats is 7 * 100 / 28 = 25
Input: 10, 20
Output: 36%

Use the attached file as your starting point.

In the American keyboard:
the first row consists of the characters "qwertyuiop",
the second row consists of the characters "asdfghjkl", and
the third row consists of the characters "zxcvbnm".

---------------

10-	Given a m x n grid filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top left to bottom right, which minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path.
Note: You can only move either down or right at any point in time.


Example 1:

Input: grid = [[1,3,1],[1,5,1],[4,2,1]] 
Output: 7 
Explanation: Because the path 1 → 3 → 1 → 1 → 1 minimizes the sum.

Example 2:
Input: grid = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]] 
Output: 12
